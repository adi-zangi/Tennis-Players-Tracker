# Tennis Players Tracker
This app is a tool for people who like to watch professional tennis to track their favorite players' progress in tournaments.

## Features
The user can select tennis players and view statistics and tournament results for each of those players, which are refreshed daily.
The user can also get notifications about the most recent tournaments.

  When the app opens for the first time, it will display a loading screen: <br />

  When the loading is completed, it will open the home screen of the app. The home screen has two tabs, labeled "Players" and "Stats".
  In the Players tab, select players by typing their names into the search box, picking the matching suggestion from the drog-down menu, and clicking the Add button: <br />
